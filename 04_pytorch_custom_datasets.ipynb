        "Find a dataset, turn the dataset into numbers, build a model (or find an existing model) to find patterns in those numbers that can be used for prediction. PyTorch has many built-in datasets used for a wide number of machine learning benchmarks, however, you'll often want to use your own custom dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "##What is a custom dataset?\n",
        "A custom dataset is a collection of data relating to a specific problem you're working on. In essence, a custom dataset can be comprised of almost anything. For example, if we were building a food image classification app like [Nutrify](https://nutrify.app/), our custom dataset might be images of food. Or if we were trying to build a model to classify whether or not a text-based review on a website was positive or negative, our custom dataset might be examples of existing customer reviews and their ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or if we were trying to build a sound classification app, our custom dataset might be sound samples alongside their sample labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or if we were trying to build a recommendation system for customers purchasing things on our website, our custom dataset might be examples of products other people have bought.\n",
        "\n",
        "PyTorch includes many existing functions to load in various custom datasets in the `TorchVision`, `TorchText`, `TorchAudio` and `TorchRec` domain libraries.\n",
        "But sometimes these existing functions may not be enough. In that case, we can always subclass `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and customize it to our liking.\n",
        "\n",
        "What we're going to cover in this notebook\n",
        "We're going to be applying the PyTorch Workflow we covered in notebook 01 and notebook 02 to a computer vision problem. But instead of using an in-built PyTorch dataset, we're going to be using our own dataset of pizza, steak and sushi images. The goal will be to load these images and then build a model to train and predict on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "What we're going to build. We'll use `torchvision.datasets` as well as our own custom Dataset class to load in images of food and then we'll build a PyTorch computer vision model to hopefully be able to classify them.\n"
